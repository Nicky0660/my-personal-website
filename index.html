    <h2><button type="button">About me</button></h2>
        <p>Hello World! <br><br> I'm Nick, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the digital world. Before my journey into the world of coding, I spent nearly a decade as a professional driver. The open road was my domain, but a burning curiosity for technology and a desire to be at the forefront of innovation ultimately led me to embark on a new adventure as a software engineer.<br><br>

            My transition from the driver's seat to the realm of coding was fueled by a passion for collaboration and a hunger to work alongside like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for pushing boundaries. Throughout my journey, I've always been recognized as a proficient problem solver and a dedicated hard worker. These qualities, honed during my years on the road, have seamlessly translated into my approach to software engineering.<br><br>
            
           What fascinates me the most is the ever-evolving landscape of technology. From elegant lines of code to the intricate dance of circuits, I find beauty in all aspects of this digital world. While my journey is still in its early stages, I'm eager to expand my horizons even further, with ambitions of venturing into the captivating realm of robotics. The thought of crafting intelligent machines that can interact with the world in ways we've only dreamed of drives my insatiable curiosity.<br><br>
            
           My academic journey began with a flourish, as I graduated in the top 1% of my high school class in 2012. However, life's unpredictable challenges have steered me away from formal education since then. But here's the thing: challenges don't intimidate me; they motivate me. Each obstacle I encounter is a chance to learn, adapt, and emerge stronger. With each line of code I write and each concept I grasp, I'm inching closer to my aspiration of becoming a skilled software engineer.<br><br>
            
           Currently, I may not boast proficiency in any programming languages, but rest assured, my journey toward mastering the craft has already commenced. I'm like a canvas waiting to be painted, an eager learner poised to absorb every drop of knowledge that comes my way. This website serves as a living testament to my growthâ€”a canvas that will gradually fill with the brushstrokes of my achievements, projects, and insights.<br><br>
            
            Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a prospective collaborator, or simply curious about my evolution, I invite you to stay connected and witness the transformation firsthand.<br><br>
            
            Here's to embracing challenges, seizing opportunities, and coding the future.<br><br>
            
            <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;">Live long</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline">Prosper</span><br>
            Nick</p>
